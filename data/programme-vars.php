	'1055 – 1225' => '<b>Plenary 1: Integrating WSH: Where safety and health meet</b>
	<br>This plenary focuses on putting health as a priority alongside safety in WSH discussion and discourse. 
		Understanding that health aspects remain closely associated with the culture and ethos of an organisation,
		the discussion emphasises the links between safety and health, and organisational productivity,
		employee satisfaction and organisational sustenance. These can also be seen as a positive indicator of an organisation’s success.
