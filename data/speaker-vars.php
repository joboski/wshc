				'International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that, annually, there are globally 2.34 million deaths from work-related accidents and diseases and 160 million cases of non-fatal work-related diseases. In addition to the incalculable human suffering to victims and their families, such accidents and diseases entail major economic losses for enterprises and societies as a whole which could amount to around 4 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP), or about US$2.8 trillion in 2013.',
				'Diseases caused by work kill six times more workers than work-related accidents. And yet occupational diseases can be invisible in public policy discussion. The reporting of such diseases is very limited in most countries, especially developing countries. The low capacity in the surveillance of workers’ health and their occupational exposure in many developing countries and the long latency period of many diseases such as occupational cancer further aggravate the difficulties in recording and reporting them.',
				'The ILO is working at the international and national levels to raise awareness on the importance of OSH and to tackle the “invisibility” of occupational diseases. The ILO will build on its achievements and the available OSH instruments to continue its support to strengthen the capacity of its constituents and help the member states in developing their Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) culture, policy, regulations and programmes on OSH including prevention of occupational diseases, compliance assurance, and compensation, in collection of data on occupational accidents and diseases, extension of occupational diseases prevention among the vulnerable groups of works including those in the informal economy and in disseminating and promoting good OSH practice.',
				'With a view to achieving greater focus and collaborative action on key issues in the world of work, the ILO has selected eight fields as Areas of Critical Importance (ACIs) for its work in the years ahead. Among them, ACI No 4 “Productivity and working conditions in SMEs”, ACI No 7 “Strengthening workplace compliance through labour inspection” and ACI No 8 “Protecting workers from unacceptable forms of work” are of particular relevance to the safety and health at work.',

			 	'International assessments of the burden of disease caused by exposures to various agents in the workplace clearly show that more people are killed by disease than by accidents. Yet national activities to prevent harm at work often place safety as a much higher priority.',
			 	'Bringing the same level of attention to protection of health presents a number of challenges. The effects of accidents at work are immediately obvious while diseases typically occur many years later. Establishing the linkage between cause and effect may not be feasible and the association may not be possible during diagnosis: many diseases can have multiple causes and the attribution towards an occupation cause may not be sufficiently strong to call it an “occupational disease”. Such work-related diseases then become a public health burden and remain individual human tragedies. In addition, the adequacy and effectiveness of control approaches are not immediately reflected in the reduction of the health effect.',
			 	'To reduce the burden of occupational disease requires greater and more widespread understanding of its prevalence and effect and concerted action to address the causes. Elimination of individuals’ exposure to the causative (or potentially causative) agent is key to reduction in disease. Assessment of personal exposure is critical to demonstrate improved performance of controls. Exposure reduction can be used as a surrogate for protection of health and lead towards elimination of exposure. By reducing exposure disease will be reduced, even though that reduction may not be able to be measured directly.',

Additionally, workplace violence may be initiated as a result of other psychosocial problems such as stress or addictions. Workplace violence can also be the source of the same psychosocial problem, producing a negative synergistic effect.',
				'With cultural diversity we have an excellent opportunity to learn from each other and capitalise on building a workplace culture that is rich and rewarding, with shared attitudes, knowledge, perceptions and beliefs. Today literature points to the fact that when workers are taking care of not only themselves but others as well, the potential for accidents and injury dramatically declines.

				'<strong>The business case for safety and health</strong><br>For business, workplace safety is a heavily regulated sphere, and it is increasingly so in many countries. However there are important drivers for improving safety that come from within organisations and markets, as opposed to it being merely a compliance task in the face of strong regulation and significant penalties. These drivers centre around the proposition that good health and safety is good business. This presentation unpacks that proposition and examines four discrete but related arguments going to the bottom line benefits for an organisation that internalises a good safety culture. These include the organisational benefits that arise from the systems based approach at the core of health and safety management; the favourable cost implications of a focus on injury avoidance and health and safety risk management; the increasing role of health and safety performance in supply chain selection; and importance of health and safety to a firm or industry’s social licence to operate. None of these factors act independently of each other, or of the regulatory environment. However they are each important in their own right as drivers of business performance, and together they are a vital element in the ongoing debate over the level of workplace health and safety regulation that is necessary.'
